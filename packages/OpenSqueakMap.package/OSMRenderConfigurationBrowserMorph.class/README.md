I'am a gui borrowed by the Preferencebrowser where the user could adapt the Renderconfiguration at run time. Basically you could change visibility, color and borderstrength for every renderobject.

Instance Variables
	attributeControls:		<PluggablePanelMorph>
	attributeList:		<PluggablePanelMorph>
	mainPanel:		<BorderedMorph>

attributeControls
	- Shows the possible setting for one attribute

attributeList
	- Shows the possible attribute to control

mainPanel
	- the mainframe where the rest is embedded
